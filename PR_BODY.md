# 🎯 LT Session Management System Implementation

Closes #105

## 📋 Summary

This PR implements a comprehensive Lightning Talk session management system as requested in Issue #105. The system allows administrators to manage LT sessions and provides users with improved session-based talk management.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 🗃️ Database & Schema Changes
- **New `lt_sessions` table** with session number, date, title, venue, and time management
- **Modified `talks` table** to include `session_id` foreign key and remove `venue` field
- **Proper database relations** with referential integrity
- **Migration scripts** for existing data

### 👨‍💼 Admin Features 
- **Session Management Tab** in admin dashboard
- **Create/Edit/Delete sessions** with validation
- **Session conflict prevention** (duplicate session numbers)
- **Time restriction management** (16:30-18:00 window)

### 📊 Dashboard Improvements
- **Session-based talk display** with proper sorting (newest sessions first)
- **Session information display** (session number, date, venue)
- **Enhanced talk editing** with session selection
- **Real-time session updates** via async API calls

### 📝 Registration & Submission
- **Session selection dropdown** instead of manual date entry
- **Automatic date display** when session is selected
- **Time validation** within session constraints
- **Future session filtering** for new submissions

### 🔧 API Enhancements
- **`/api/lt-sessions`** - Full CRUD operations for sessions
- **`/api/available-sessions`** - Filtered session access for forms
- **`/api/migrate-talks`** - Data migration utility
- **Enhanced `/api/user-talks`** - JOIN queries with session data
- **Updated `/api/talks`** - Session-based talk management

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### ✅ Build & Type Safety
- **TypeScript errors resolved** - All type definitions updated
- **ESLint warnings fixed** - Clean code standards maintained
- **Successful build** - Production ready (`✓ Compiled successfully`)
- **Extended type definitions** - Session fields properly typed

### 🔍 Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ Admin session management (create, edit, delete)
- ✅ Dashboard talk editing with session updates  
- ✅ Registration form session selection
- ✅ Data migration for existing talks
- ✅ API endpoint functionality
- ✅ Duplicate session prevention
- ✅ Time constraint validation

## 📊 Migration Results

Successfully migrated **6 existing talks** to session-based structure:
- **第1回** (2025-05-30): 1 talk
- **第2回** (2025-06-30): 2 talks  
- **第3回** (2025-07-31): 1 talk
- **第5回** (2025-09-30): 2 talks

## 📚 Documentation

- **API documentation** in `docs/design/apis.md`
- **Database design** in `docs/design/db.md`
- **Implementation plan** in `docs/design/implementation-plan.md`
- **Testing strategy** in `docs/design/testing-plan.md`
- **Migration scripts** in `docs/design/migration-*.sql`

## 🔄 Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Database Schema Changes**:
- Added `session_id` to `talks` table
- Removed `venue` from `talks` table (moved to `lt_sessions`)
- Existing venue data migrated to session-based structure

⚠️ **API Changes**:
- Talk creation/update now requires `session_id` instead of `presentation_date`/`venue`
- Session management APIs added

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- **Improved time display** on dashboard (left-aligned, cleaner layout)
- **Session information badges** showing session numbers
- **Better visual hierarchy** with session-grouped talks
- **Enhanced form validation** with clear error messages
- **Responsive session selection** with real-time preview

## 🚀 Performance

- **Optimized queries** with JOIN operations for session data
- **Efficient sorting** by session date (newest first)
- **Proper indexing** on session dates and numbers
- **Async operations** for better user experience

---

**This implementation fully addresses all requirements from Issue #105 and provides a robust foundation for LT session management.** 🎉

## Screenshots

The system is now live and all functionality has been tested and verified working correctly.
